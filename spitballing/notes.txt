what happens in a web app?

events happen

when they do, changes get applied

the app waits for another event to happen


i want to make it easy to describe when x do y


basically i want vue without templates and super lightweight

element.scope = { 
  user: {
    name: 'John',
    addresses: [
      {
        street: '4017 Westfield Dr'
      }
    ]
  }
}

<h1 bind:innerText="user.name"></h1>

<li bind:for="address of user.addresses">
  <span bind:innerText="address.street"></span>
</li>
