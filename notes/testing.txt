i want to be able to test multiple browsers

i want to be able to test in the browsers

i want to be able to test performance


why test?
- prevent regressions
- easily test highly specific scenarios
- test driven development, document requirements and what is/isn't done. help me think through edge cases.

test cases
- render set vs delete (invidual re-rendering)
- performance baseline ()
- basic non-happy path cases
- observable and non-observable scope, including non-object types
